### Final Machine Learning practical activity (Breast Cancer Detector):

In this practice, 4 classification algorithms for the identification of Breast cancer were implemented. Are they: 

* Logistic Regression 
* Decision Tree Classifier 
* K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier 
* Random Forest Classifier 

The dataset used was from the following link: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29>. The file can be edited or read in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. At the end of the file there is a comparison of the results of each algorithm.
